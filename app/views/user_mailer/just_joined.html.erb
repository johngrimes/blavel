Hi <%= @user.login %>,

Welcome and thanks for joining!

Blavel is a tight-knit group of travellers, but we always love getting new members. We love to use the site to share stories and pictures with our friends, family and fellow Blavellers as we travel, and we hope you do too.

It's very addictive once you get going, and the best part is that you're always left with a great record of your travels once you get back home.

The first thing that you will notice when you login at Blavel is that your home page will be quite empty.

This is because you are not yet following anybody! We find that the best way to keep up to date on the travels of everybody you know or are interested in is to start following them. If you don't know anybody else on Blavel yet, just go for a browse and check out the other people posting.

Following a person is as easy as clicking the 'start following' link on their profile page. You can get to a person's profile page by clicking on their name, whereever you see it.

Once you are following a person, updates to their travel blog will be included in your summary of 'what's happening'. 

Alternatively, you can always click on the 'browse' link to check out the newest posts by all Blavellers, whether you are following them or not.

We also encourage you to fill in some of the information on your profile page, so that we can get to know you a bit better. Your new profile page is here:
<%= @profile_page_url %>

If you are a Facebook user, we have posted a page that shows you how to link your new Blavel to your Facebook profile.
<%= @facebook_help_url %>

Hopefully this is all the information you need to get started.

If you have any questions, email us at feedback@blavel.com. Unlike a lot of other web sites, a real person will respond to your email quickly and take whatever problems you have through to resolution.

Happy Blavelling!

Love from Blavel
