I found this piece of code at
http://www.stephenchu.com/2006/06/how-to-use-gmail-smtp-server-to-send.html,
but couldn't find it hosted anywhere, so voila!

Type
script/plugin install git://github.com/johngrimes/action_mailer_tls.git 
to install it.

Here is the accompanying example configuration:
ActionMailer::Base.server_settings = {
  :address => "smtp.gmail.com",
  :port => 587,
  :domain => "mycompany.com",
  :authentication => :plain,
  :user_name => "username",
  :password => "password"
}
